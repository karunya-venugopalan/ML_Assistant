The project uses python to analyse and predict any training dataset such as Hoam loan prediction, Diabetes prediction etc. It fits the training data into different Supervised Machine Learning models and chooses the one with highest accuracy to make predictions. Graphs and inferences from the analysis will be written and stored in a pdf file.
